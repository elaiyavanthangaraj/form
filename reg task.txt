Regular Expression Tasks

1. Character Classification
   Write a JavaScript program that takes a single character as input and checks whether it is:  
   - An uppercase letter  
   - A lowercase letter  
   - A digit  
   - A special character  
   Use regular expressions to classify the input.

2. Input Filtering
   Create a program that restricts user input based on specific criteria:  
   - Allow alphabets only (both uppercase and lowercase).  
   - Allow numbers only.  
   - Allow a combination of alphabets and numbers (alphanumeric).  
   Use regular expressions to validate the input.

3. Data Parsing from Strings
   Write a JavaScript function to parse and extract specific information from a given text:  
   - Extract URLs from the text.  
   - Extract dates in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`.  
   - Extract mentions (e.g., `@username` on social media platforms).  


4. Email Address Validation
   Write a regular expression to validate email addresses. The pattern should match standard email formats like `user@example.com`, ensuring the following:  
   - Contains a valid username (letters, numbers, underscores).  
   - Contains an `@` symbol.  
   - Has a valid domain name and extension (e.g., `.com`, `.net`).  

5. Date Validation (DD/MM/YYYY)
   Create a regular expression that validates dates in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`:  
   - Days must be valid (01-31).  
   - Months must be valid (01-12).  
   - Years should be four digits.  


6. File Extension Extraction  
   Write a regular expression to extract file extensions from a list of filenames. For example:  
   - Input: `"image.png", "document.pdf", "archive.zip"`  
   - Output: `["png", "pdf", "zip"]`

7.Phone Number Validation
Create a regular expression to validate phone numbers in different formats

8.Password Strength Validation
Write a regular expression to validate strong passwords. A strong password should:

Contain at least 8 characters.
Include at least one uppercase letter.
Include at least one lowercase letter.
Contain at least one digit.
Include at least one special character (e.g., @, #, $).

function character(s) {
    if (s || s.length ==1[0,9]) {
        return "Please provide a single character.";
    }
    
    if (/^[A-Z]$/.test(s)) {
        return "Uppercase Letter";
    } else if (/^[a-z]$/.test(s)) {
        return "Lowercase Letter";
    } else if (/^\d$/.test(s)) {
        return "Digit";
    } else {
        return "Special Character";
    }
}

let input2 = ("Enter a single character:");
console.log(character(input2));
